## Updates [October 27, 2025]
- We are integrating vLLM to improve the speed and efficiency of the GRPO pipeline. We expect this to be pushed by end of week.
- Checkpoints along with the custom DNA-LLM model class will be released on HuggingFace by end of week.
- More training results with GRPO will be shared soon.

## Abstract

Unlocking deep, interpretable biological reasoning from complex genomic data is a major AI challenge hindering scientific discovery. Current DNA foundation models, despite strong sequence representation, struggle with multi-step reasoning and lack inherent transparent, biologically intuitive explanations. We introduce BioReason, a pioneering architecture that, for the first time, deeply integrates a DNA foundation model with a large language model (LLM). This novel connection enables the LLM to directly process and reason with genomic information as a fundamental input, fostering a new form of multimodal biological understanding. BioReason's sophisticated multi-step reasoning is developed through supervised fine-tuning and targeted reinforcement learning, guiding the system to generate logical, biologically coherent deductions. On biological reasoning benchmarks including KEGG-based disease pathway prediction‚Äîwhere accuracy improves from 88% to 97%‚Äîand variant effect prediction, BioReason demonstrates an average 15% performance gain over strong single-modality baselines.

## Key Contributions

‚Ä¢ **Novel multimodal architecture**: The first successful integration of a DNA foundation model with an LLM, establishing a new methodology for AI-driven biological studies.

‚Ä¢ **Advanced reasoning methodology**: A systematic training approach combining supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning that incentivizes multi-step biological reasoning.

‚Ä¢ **New biological reasoning benchmarks**: Development and curation of novel benchmarks for evaluating biological reasoning capabilities, including an annotated reasoning dataset for gene pathway and disease prediction from KEGG.

‚Ä¢ **Empirical performance improvements**: Demonstration that BioReason outperforms both DNA foundation models and LLMs used independently or in simple combination, with average performance gains of 15%+ over baseline.

‚Ä¢ **Interpretable reasoning traces**: A mechanism for generating step-by-step biological reasoning traces that provide interpretable predictions, enhancing scientific insight and hypothesis generation.
